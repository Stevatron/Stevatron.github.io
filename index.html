        <h2>About me:</h2>
        <p>I am currently a third-year student at MEF University, pursuing Applied Information Technologies. Some of the
            courses
            I have taken include Python, Object Oriented Programming (C++), Web Development (HTML5, CSS3, JS, jQuery,
            AJAX),
            C#
            (with a primary focus on OOP), Discrete Mathematics, Probability and Statistics, and Linear Algebra. I also
            have
            experience in Computer Graphics using Adobe Illustrator and Adobe Photoshop, as well as Computer Networks
            and
            Communications involving ISO standards and protocols.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="projekti scroll-animation">
        <p>I have completed two personal projects: a Console Casino Game (C++) that demonstrates OOP principles and
            includes
            two
            games, Blackjack and Roulette, and a Shopping App (C#) that utilizes Windows Forms, JSON file
            implementation,
            and
            features administration/statistics and selling/billing functionalities.</p>
        <p>Both of the projects can be found on my github.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="interests scroll-animation">
        <p>In addition to my academic pursuits, I have a passion for anime, manga/manhwa, working out, and martial arts.
            I
            am also huge Warhammer fan, as you already assumed by the style of the site.</p>
